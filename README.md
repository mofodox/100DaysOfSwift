# 100DaysSwift

This repository is to record my journey learning Swift programming with [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100).

On the other hand, the README will be a place to show the summary of each day learnings.

## Day 1 to 12 Summary

- Day 1 (Variables, simple data types and string interpolation)
    1. You make variables using `var` and constants using `let`. It's preferable to use constants as often as possible.
        - [constants](https://github.com/mofodox/100DaysOfSwift/tree/main/constants.playground)
        - [variables](https://github.com/mofodox/100DaysOfSwift/tree/main/variables.playground)
    2. Strings start and end with double quotes, but if you want them to run across multiple lines you should use three sets of double quotes.
        - [strings, multiline strings](https://github.com/mofodox/100DaysOfSwift/tree/main/strings-integers.playground)
    3. Integers hold whole numbers, doubles hold fractional numbers and booleans hold true or false.
        - [integers](https://github.com/mofodox/100DaysOfSwift/tree/main/strings-integers.playground)
        - [doubles and booleans](https://github.com/mofodox/100DaysOfSwift/tree/main/doubles-booleans.playground)
    4. String interpolation allows you to create strings from other variables and constants, placing their values inside your string.
        - [string interpolation](https://github.com/mofodox/100DaysOfSwift/tree/main/strings-integers.playground)
    5. Swift uses type inference to assign each variable or constant a type, but you can provide explicit types if you want.
        - [type annotation](https://github.com/mofodox/100DaysOfSwift/tree/main/typeannotations.playground)
