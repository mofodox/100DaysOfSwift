import UIKit

// To create a constant in Swift, we use the let keyword.
// Variables are mutable, constant is immutable means once it is set, you cannot change later.

let taylor = "swift"

// Uncomment this code below to see the error message if you try to change the value of a constant
//let dna = false
//dna = true // the error message will look something like this - change 'let' to 'var' to make it mutable
